## 🔧 Technical Achievements

### 1. GitHub Actions Modernization ✅
**Before**: Workflow failing with deprecation errors
```yaml
❌ actions/upload-artifact@v3 (deprecated)
❌ actions/setup-python@v4 (outdated)
❌ actions/cache@v3 (outdated)
❌ codecov/codecov-action@v3 (outdated)
```

**After**: All actions updated to latest versions
```yaml
✅ actions/upload-artifact@v4
✅ actions/setup-python@v5
✅ actions/cache@v4
✅ codecov/codecov-action@v4
```

### 2. Enhanced CI/CD Pipeline ✅
- **Multi-stage testing**: basic → advanced → lint
- **Matrix strategy**: Python 3.11 & 3.12 support
- **Coverage reporting**: HTML + XML with Codecov integration
- **Artifact management**: Test results and coverage uploads
- **Performance optimization**: Dependency caching and parallel execution

### 3. Code Quality Standards ✅
