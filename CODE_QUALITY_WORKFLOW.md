# Modern Python Code Quality & Development Workflow

## 🎯 Overview

This document describes the comprehensive code quality and development workflow implemented for the Funnel Analytics Platform. The workflow enforces modern Python development standards through automated tooling, pre-commit hooks, and unified developer commands.

## 🛠️ Tools & Configuration

### Core Tools
- **Ruff**: Fast Python linter and formatter (replaces flake8, isort, and more)
- **Black**: Uncompromising Python code formatter
- **MyPy**: Static type checker for Python
- **Pre-commit**: Git hook framework for quality gates
- **Pytest**: Testing framework with coverage reporting

### Configuration Files
- `.pre-commit-config.yaml`: Pre-commit hooks configuration
- `pyproject.toml`: Modern Python project configuration (replaces setup.cfg)
- `Makefile`: Unified development commands
- `requirements-dev.txt`: Development dependencies

## 🚀 Developer Workflow

### One-Time Setup
```bash
# Install development dependencies
make install-dev

# Install pre-commit hooks
make pre-commit
```

### Daily Development
```bash
# Before committing changes
make check          # Format code + run all quality checks

# Run tests
make test           # Full test suite with coverage
make test-fast      # Quick validation

# Manual operations
make lint           # Check code quality without formatting
make format         # Auto-format code only
```

### Available Commands
Run `make help` to see all available commands:

- **Setup**: `install`, `install-dev`, `clean`
- **Quality**: `lint`, `format`, `check`
- **Testing**: `test`, `test-fast`, `test-coverage`
- **Development**: `run`, `docs`

## 🔧 Tool Configurations

### Ruff Configuration
```toml
[tool.ruff]
line-length = 99
target-version = "py38"

[tool.ruff.lint]
select = ["E", "F", "W", "B", "C", "N", "SIM"]
ignore = ["E501"]  # Line length handled by black
```

### Black Configuration
```toml
[tool.black]
line-length = 99
target-version = ['py38']
```

### MyPy Configuration
```toml
[tool.mypy]
python_version = "3.8"
strict = true
ignore_missing_imports = true
```

## 🚪 Pre-commit Gates

The following checks run automatically before each commit:

1. **File Hygiene**
   - Trim trailing whitespace
   - Fix end of files
   - Check YAML/TOML/JSON syntax
   - Check for merge conflicts
   - Prevent large file commits

2. **Code Quality**
   - Ruff linting (226 issues currently identified)
   - Black formatting (auto-fixes applied)
   - MyPy type checking (113 type errors to resolve)

3. **Python Debugging**
   - Detect debug statements (print, pdb, etc.)

## 📊 Current Code Quality Status

### Linting Issues (Ruff)
- **Total Issues**: 226
- **Categories**: Unused variables, bare except clauses, line length, code style
- **Auto-fixable**: Many issues can be resolved with `make format`
- **Manual fixes**: Some require code review and manual correction

### Type Checking Issues (MyPy)
- **Total Errors**: 113 across 6 files
- **Main files**: `run_tests.py`, `script.py`, `path_analyzer.py`, `app.py`
- **Categories**: Missing type annotations, incompatible types, undefined names

### Recommendations
1. **Immediate**: Address auto-fixable linting issues with `make format`
2. **Short-term**: Add type annotations to resolve mypy errors
3. **Ongoing**: Use `make check` before all commits to maintain quality

## 🏗️ Integration with Existing Architecture

### Professional Testing Standards
The workflow integrates with the existing comprehensive test suite:
- **150+ test files** covering all functionality
- **Polars and Pandas** engine compatibility testing
- **Fallback detection** and error handling validation
- **Performance benchmarking** and scalability testing

### CI/CD Compatibility
The Makefile commands are designed for CI/CD integration:
```bash
# CI pipeline example
make install-dev
make check          # Format + lint + type check
make test           # Run full test suite
```

### Team Onboarding
New developers can get started quickly:
1. Clone repository
2. Run `make install-dev`
3. Use `make check` before commits
4. Follow the pre-commit feedback

## 🎛️ Customization

### Adding New Tools
Add to `.pre-commit-config.yaml`:
```yaml
- repo: https://github.com/new-tool/repo
  rev: v1.0.0
  hooks:
    - id: new-tool
```

### Adjusting Rules
Modify `pyproject.toml`:
```toml
[tool.ruff.lint]
ignore = ["E501", "F841"]  # Add rule codes to ignore
```

### Environment-Specific Settings
Use `requirements-dev.txt` for development-only dependencies:
```
ruff>=0.1.0
black>=23.0.0
mypy>=1.5.0
```

## 📈 Benefits

### Code Quality
- **Consistent formatting** across the entire codebase
- **Early error detection** before code review
- **Type safety** improvements with mypy
- **Best practices** enforcement with ruff

### Developer Experience
- **Unified commands** via Makefile
- **Automated formatting** reduces manual work
- **Fast feedback** with pre-commit hooks
- **Clear documentation** of standards and processes

### Team Productivity
- **Reduced code review** time on formatting issues
- **Consistent tooling** across all environments
- **Easy onboarding** for new team members
- **CI/CD ready** command structure

## 🔄 Maintenance

### Regular Updates
```bash
# Update pre-commit hooks
pre-commit autoupdate

# Update development dependencies
pip install -U ruff black mypy pre-commit pytest
```

### Monitoring
- Check `make check` output regularly
- Review pre-commit hook performance
- Update ignore rules as needed
- Monitor tool version compatibility
