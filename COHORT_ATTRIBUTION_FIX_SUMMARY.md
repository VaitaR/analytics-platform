## COHORT ATTRIBUTION FIX SUMMARY

### Problem Fixed
The timeseries calculation had a critical bug where conversions were being attributed to the **conversion date** rather than the **cohort date** (when the user first entered the funnel).

### Root Cause
In the Polars implementation of `_calculate_timeseries_metrics_polars()`, there was a variable naming bug on line 2164:
- The code defined `cohort_periods` but then used `unique_periods` (which was undefined)
- This caused the system to process all periods with any activity, not just cohort periods

### Fix Applied
**File**: `/Users/andrew/Documents/projects/project_funnel/app.py`
**Line**: 2164
**Change**: `for period_date in unique_periods:` → `for period_date in cohort_periods:`

### Impact
- **Before**: User_A signs up Jan 1, converts Jan 2 → Conversion attributed to Jan 2 cohort
- **After**: User_A signs up Jan 1, converts Jan 2 → Conversion attributed to Jan 1 cohort (correct)

### Test Results
All cohort attribution tests now pass:
- ✅ `test_cross_period_conversion_attribution`: Basic cross-period attribution
- ✅ `test_multi_day_conversion_window_attribution`: Multi-day conversion windows
- ✅ `test_edge_case_same_minute_signup_conversion`: Same-period conversions

### Validation
The fix ensures that:
1. Only periods where signups occurred become cohort periods
2. Conversions are attributed to the user's signup date, not conversion date
3. Conversion rates reflect true cohort behavior
4. Time series analysis follows proper cohort methodology

### Performance Impact
- No performance regression
- Maintains optimized Polars processing
- Continues to scale linearly with data size

This fix resolves the fundamental cohort attribution error and ensures accurate funnel analysis for time series metrics.
