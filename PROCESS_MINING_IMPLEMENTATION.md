- Export-ready professional visualizations

## üîß Usage Instructions

### **Accessing Process Mining**
1. Load data (sample, upload, or ClickHouse)
2. Configure and run funnel analysis
3. Navigate to **üîç Process Mining** tab
4. Configure analysis parameters
5. Click **üöÄ Discover Process**
6. Explore interactive diagram and data tables

### **Customization Options**
```python
# Example process mining call:
process_data = path_analyzer.discover_process_mining_structure(
    events_data,
    min_frequency=5,        # Hide low-frequency transitions
    include_cycles=True,    # Detect repetitive patterns
    time_window_hours=168   # 7-day analysis window
)

# Create visualization:
fig = visualizer.create_process_mining_diagram(
    process_data,
    layout_algorithm="hierarchical",  # Best for process flows
    show_frequencies=True,           # Display transition counts
    show_statistics=True            # Include activity metrics
)
```

## üöÄ Next Steps

The process mining functionality is fully integrated and ready for production use. The implementation provides:

- ‚úÖ Complete process discovery from user events
- ‚úÖ Professional interactive visualizations
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive insights and analytics
- ‚úÖ Seamless integration with existing platform
