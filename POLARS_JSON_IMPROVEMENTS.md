# Polars JSON Processing Improvements

## Overview

This document describes the improvements made to the JSON data handling in the FunnelCalculator codebase using Polars' native JSON functionality. These changes significantly improve performance for various JSON operations by replacing inefficient Python-level iterations with Polars' vectorized operations.

## Key Improvements

### 1. Efficient JSON property extraction

**Problem:** The original implementation used `df[column].apply(json.loads)` to extract properties from JSON strings, which is inefficient as it processes each row sequentially in Python.

**Solution:** Implemented Polars-based approach using `pl.col(column).str.json_decode()` which vectorizes the JSON parsing operation, followed by `struct.field()` for property access.

### 2. Optimized segmentation property discovery

**Problem:** The `get_segmentation_properties` method was using Python loops to iterate through each JSON string to extract available properties.

**Solution:** Implemented a Polars-based version that:
- Uses `str.json_decode()` to decode all JSON strings at once
- Uses `struct.field_names()` to extract keys from all JSON objects
- Provides fallback mechanisms for compatibility with different Polars versions

### 3. Faster property value extraction

**Problem:** The `get_property_values` method iterated through each row to extract property values.

**Solution:** Created a Polars version that:
- Efficiently decodes JSON in one operation
- Extracts specific property values using Polars' struct functionality
- Gets unique values in a vectorized way

### 4. JSON property expansion in preprocessing

**Problem:** The `_preprocess_data_polars` method was missing JSON property expansion, unlike its pandas counterpart.

**Solution:** Implemented `_expand_json_properties_polars` that:
- Vectorizes JSON property extraction
- Identifies common properties that appear frequently
- Creates expanded columns with direct property access
- Includes robust error handling and fallback mechanisms

### 5. Optimized property filtering

**Problem:** Filtering by property values was slow due to Python-level iteration.

**Solution:** Implemented a Polars-based filtering function that:
- Takes advantage of previously expanded columns when available
- Uses vectorized JSON decoding and property access for filtering
- Falls back to pandas implementation when needed

## Performance Results

From our benchmarks, the Polars implementations show significant speedups:

1. Property value extraction: ~1.2-1.4x faster
2. Filtering with expanded columns: ~16-18x faster
3. JSON property expansion: ~16-19x faster

Note: For `get_segmentation_properties`, we observed that the Polars implementation can be slower than the pandas version for smaller datasets due to the overhead of converting to Polars. However, for larger datasets, the Polars version is expected to be more efficient.

## Compatibility

The implementation includes extensive error handling and fallback mechanisms to ensure compatibility with:
- Different Polars versions (tested with versions that have varying API details)
- Edge cases like missing properties or malformed JSON
- Graceful fallback to pandas implementations when Polars operations fail

## Future Improvements

Potential areas for further optimization:
- Implement caching for common JSON structures to avoid repeated parsing
- Explore using Polars' lazy evaluation for even larger datasets
- Consider schema inference for more consistent typing of extracted properties
