**📊 How to read Funnel Chart:**

• **Overall conversion** — shows funnel efficiency across the entire data period  
• **Drop-off between steps** — identifies where you lose the most users (optimization priority)  
• **Volume at each step** — helps resource planning and result forecasting  

💡 *These metrics are aggregated over the entire period and may differ from temporal trends in Time Series*

st.markdown("### 🌊 Flow Diagram Explanation")
st.info("""
**🌊 How to read Flow Diagram:**

• **Flow thickness** — proportional to user count (where are the biggest losses?)  
• **Visual bottlenecks** — immediately reveals problematic transitions in the funnel  
• **Alternative view** — same statistics as Funnel Chart, but in Sankey format  

💡 *Great for stakeholder presentations and identifying critical loss points*
""")

st.markdown("### 📈 Time Series Analysis Explanation")
st.info("""
**📈 How to read Time Series:**

• **Temporal trends** — see conversion dynamics changing over time periods  
• **Seasonality and anomalies** — identify growth/decline patterns for decision making  
• **Period-specific conversions** — each point = conversion only in that period (≤100%)  

⚠️ *Conversions may differ from Funnel Chart, as these are calculated by periods, not over entire time*
