"""
Comprehensive UI Test Suite for Funnel Analytics Application

This test suite follows the five guiding principles for resilient UI testing:
1. Principle of Stable Selectors - Test by key, not by label or text
2. Principle of State-Driven Assertion - Assert on st.session_state, not just UI
3. Principle of Abstraction - Use Page Object Model (POM) pattern
4. Principle of Data-Driven Visualization Testing - Test the spec, not pixels
5. Principle of Atomic and Independent Tests - Each test is self-contained

Requirements:
- streamlit[testing] >= 1.28.0
- All critical widgets in app.py must have unique key attributes
